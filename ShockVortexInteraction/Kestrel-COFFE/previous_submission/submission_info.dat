Solver: Kestrel using the finite element solver COFFE
Results provide for P1 meshes RQ50, RQ100, RQ150, RQ200, RQ250, RQ300, RQ400, RQ500
Run with 4 different time step sizes: 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.01
Run with 3 different time integration methods: SDIRK22, SDIRK33, and SDIRK45, which are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-order, respectively.

Directory layout is as follows:
[mesh]
-[time step]
--[time integration method]

Data for lines 1-3 are provided in Tecplot ascii format

Images were created in the following manner:
-Paraview used to compute gradient of density at each node
-Paraview used to compute Schlieren value at each node
-Schlieren values dumped to CSV
-CSV read into Python Pandas DataFrame
-Matplotlib imshow used with interpolation='bilinear'. This allowed me to create an image that is exactly the flow domain requested.
-vortexFull.png is the entire domain [0,2] x [0,1]
-vortexZoom.png is the subdomain [0.9,1.2] x [0.33,0.63]
-All images are grayscale using the 'binary' colormap in imshow and the colormap ranges from 0.05 to 2.4
