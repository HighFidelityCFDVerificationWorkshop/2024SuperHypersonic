# 2024 High-Fidelity Workshop: Shock-Dominated Flows Section
This repository is a resource for the Shock-Dominated Flows test suite working group in the 2024 High-Fidelity CFD Verification Workshop.
The group meets every second Thursday of the month at 11am US Eastern Time.
Please contact [Matt Zahr](mailto:mzahr@nd.edu) or [Kevin Holst](kholst@utk.edu) for a meeting link.
The cases were described in a
[SciTech 2023 paper](https://highfidelitycfdverificationworkshop.github.io/papers/superhypersonic.pdf). The Sajben diffuser has been updated since this publications; the current version can be found [here](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024SuperHypersonic/blob/main/UpdatedSajbenDiffuser.pdf)

## Additional Case Information
Additional case information including meshes, preliminary results, experimental data, etc. will be
provided in this repository as they become available.
