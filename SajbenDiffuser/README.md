# Sajben Transonic Diffuser

More information about this case can be found on the [NPARC Alliance website](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/transdif/transdif.html).
Baseline geometry information can be found there as well. Note that a slip wall region upstream of the entrance to the diffuser was added for
this workshop case.
