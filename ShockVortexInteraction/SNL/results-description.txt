Shock vortex interaction problem. Each directory contains line profiles and Schlieren plots. 

For all results, time explicit 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme was used with a fixed global time step 

Directory layout:
sccfv/sc4 - structured cell-centered finite volume results simulated using the low-dissipation Subbareddy-Candler inviscid flux with 4th order central flux
sccfv/hcusp-hybrid - structured cell-entered finite volume results simulated using the hybridized low-dissipation flux splitting scheme (LDFSS)
dg/p1-lgl-av - unstructured discontinuous Galerkin results simulated using the entropy-stable inviscid flux on P1 Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto solution points stablized with the entropy-stable artificial viscosity method
dg/p1-lgl-av-pde - unstructure discontinuous Galerkin results simulated using the entropy-stable inviscid flux on P1 Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto solution points stabilized with a PDE-based entropy stable artificial viscosity method 
dg/p3-lgl-av - unstructured discontinuous Galerkin results simulated using the entropy-stable inviscid flux on P3 Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto solution points stablized with the entropy-stable artificial viscosity method
dg/p3-lgl-av-pde - unstructured discontinuous Galerkin results simulated using the entropy-stable inviscid flux on P3 Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto solution points stabilized with a PDE-based entropy stable artificial viscosity method
