Solver: Deneb, High-order CFD solver based on DRM-DG method
Results provide for P1 meshes RQ50, RQ100, RQ150, RQ200, RQ250, RQ300, RQ350, RQ400, RQ450, RQ500
Run with 2 different approximation orders: DG-P2 and DG-P3, which are 3rd and 4th-order, respectively.
Numerical flux: Roe's FDS scheme
Shock-capturing: Shock-capturing PID (SPID) method
Temporal discretization: explicit 3rd-order TVDRK method with CFL=0.9

Directory layout is as follows:
[mesh]
-[approximation order]

Data for lines 1-3 are provided in Tecplot ascii format

Images were created in the following manner:
-Tecplot used to compute gradient of density at each node
-Tecplot used to compute Schlieren value at each node
-vortexFull.png is the entire domain [0,2] x [0,1]
-vortexZoom.png is the subdomain [0.9,1.2] x [0.33,0.63]
-All images are grayscale using the 'binary' colormap in imshow and the colormap ranges from 0.05 to 2.4.
