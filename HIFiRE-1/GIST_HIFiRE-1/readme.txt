In the previous HIFiRE-1 results conducted at GIST, there were pressure and heat flux oscillations on the windward side.
And the residuals were relatively high value ranging from -8 to -9 ordrs.

In the updated results, non-reflecting boundary condition (NRBC) was used to prevent waves reflected from the wall being trapped within the computation domain.
And I use entropy fix method to overcome the weakness of Roe-flux differencing in the shock flow.

These approach reduced oscillation on the windward side for both pressure and heat flux.
Also, the residual was reduced to the level of machine error.
