Solver: Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin with subcell finite volume discontinuity-capturing
Results provided for P=[1,2,3,4] with 10 mesh resolutions for each solution order
Time integration done via an explicit third-order SSP Runge-Kutta scheme with CFL = 0.45
MUSCL subcell reconstruction for P=[1,2,3,4]
WENO5 subcell reconstruction for P=[2,3,4]
Discontinuity detection done via shock and entropy wave sensors

Directory layout is as follows:
[approximation order]
-[mesh]
--[subcell reconstruction scheme]

Data for lines 1-3 are provided in .csv format

Images were created in the following manner:
-Paraview used to sample DG density field and take the gradient
-Paraview used to compute Schlieren value at sample points and save images
-vortexFull.png is the entire domain [0,2] x [0,1]
-vortexZoom.png is the subdomain [0.9,1.2] x [0.33,0.63]
-All images are grayscale using the 'X Ray' colormap and the colormap ranges from 0.05 to 2.4
